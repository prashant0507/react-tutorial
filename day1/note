*** React is single page application

*** React can apply to any Element in the existing app that's why it's called Library

*** React.createELement took 3 param React.createElement("Element", {attribute}, "Content")
   React.createElement("h1", {id:"h1"}, "hello world")

*** We can use React in any project using CDN Link

*** React Hosted on CDN

*** React.createELement create React Element Object Not HTML 

*** render() method will take this object and will convert in HTML Tag 

*** react.development.js is responsible for core feature for React

*** react-dom.development.js is responsible for DOM related Operation
 
*** <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
*** <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

*** Above 2 different file one is for core feature of React and another one for DOM

*** Suppose we are working on mobile app that time react-dom file not required. we need only react.development that's why both file are seprate
